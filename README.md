# CMOS-Inverter-Schematic-Layout
A CMOS inverter is a very simple circuit, designed with two opposite-polarity MOSFETs within a complementary way.
The logic element like an inverter reverses the applied input signal. 
The quality of the inverter can be measured frequently by using the VTC or voltage transfer curve, which is plotted between input voltage (Vin) and output voltage (Vo).
